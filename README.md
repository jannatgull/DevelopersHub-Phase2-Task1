# DevelopersHub-Phase2-Task1
# Banking and Customer Analytics Projects

This repository contains three major projects related to **predictive analytics, customer segmentation, and risk modeling** in the banking and retail domains. Each project demonstrates practical applications of **machine learning** and **data science techniques** to solve real-world business problems.

## Task 1: Term Deposit Subscription Prediction (Bank Marketing)

**Objective:**  
Predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit as a result of a marketing campaign, enabling the bank to optimize its marketing efforts and target the right customers.

**Dataset:**  
Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository) – contains information on customer demographics, contact details, and campaign interactions.

**Instructions / Approach:**  
1. **Load and Explore the Dataset**  
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, correlations, and relationships.  
   - Handle missing values if any.

2. **Encode Categorical Features**  
   - Use one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert categorical variables into numeric format suitable for machine learning models.

3. **Train Classification Models**  
   - Implement models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.  
   - Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.

4. **Evaluate the Models**  
   - Use **Confusion Matrix**, **F1-Score**, and **ROC Curve** to assess performance.  
   - Compare models based on precision, recall, and overall accuracy.

5. **Explain Model Predictions (XAI)**  
   - Apply **SHAP** or **LIME** to interpret at least 5 individual predictions.  
   - Understand which features influence subscription decisions most.

**Skills Gained:**  
- Classification modeling  
- Feature encoding and preprocessing  
- Model evaluation using advanced metrics  
- Explainable AI (XAI)  
- Customer behavior analysis
